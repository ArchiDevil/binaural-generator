Binaural Wave Generator

This software is created for generation of binaural waves to achieve altered states of consciousness. Just compile, open and create you own presets.

This software uses .NET Framework 4.5, OxyPlot to render graphs and NAudio to playback waves.
This software can generate different sinus waves, and different noise types.

Also, this software includes sitter generator, to provide different binaural waves to work in pair. 
Subject listens to the waves, and sitter changes waves and noise to achieve some result. You can also use some sensors to control consciousness state of subject.
